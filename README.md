## Introduction

This module defines types representing [finite fields][galois-fields-wiki]. It
supports both fields of prime order and of prime power order.

[galois-fields-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field

## Synopsis

The easiest way to create Galois fields is with the `@GaloisField` and `@GaloisField!`
macros. Typically, you use the former for a field of prime order and the latter
for a field of prime power order. In the prime power case, you pass a display
name / variable name for the primitive element.

```julia
using GaloisFields

const F = @GaloisField 29     # ‚Ñ§/29‚Ñ§
const G = @GaloisField! 27 Œ≤   # degree-3 extension of ‚Ñ§/3‚Ñ§; multiplicatively generated by Œ≤

F(2)^29 == F(2)
Œ≤^27 == Œ≤
```

The exclamation mark `!` is intended to convey that the macro has a side-effect:
for example, in the code above, it assigns a variable called `Œ≤`.

The macros also accept special symbols for specifying the field. This is more
difficult to type ([docs][unicode-input]) but more elegant to read:

```julia
const F = @GaloisField ‚Ñ§/29‚Ñ§
const G = @GaloisField ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Çá Œ≤
```

If you want to pass your own generator for the representation of a field
of order ``q = p^n``, you can:

```julia
const F = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚ÇÉ Œ≤^2 + Œ≤ + 2
Œ≤^2 + Œ≤ + 2 == 0
```

Lastly, there's also function interfaces in cases where macros are not
appropriate:

```julia
const F = GaloisField(29)               # ‚Ñ§/29‚Ñ§
const G, Œ≤ = GaloisField(81, :Œ≤)        # degree-4 extension of ‚Ñ§/3‚Ñ§
const G, Œ≤ = GaloisField(3, 4, :Œ≤)      # same; avoid having to factorize 81
const F, Œ≤ = GaloisField(3, :Œ≤ => [2, 0, 0, 2, 1]) # same; pass our own custom minimum polynomial
```

## Fast multiplications
In some cases, we make use of [Zech's logarithms][zech] for faster multiplications.
By default, this happens if the order of the field is less than ``2^16``, if the
characteristic is not 2, and if the primitive element is also a multiplicative
generator. However, you can override this by calling either of

```julia
GaloisFields.enable_zech_multiplication(F)
GaloisFields.disable_zech_multiplication(F)
```

_before_ doing any multiplication operation. If you call this function on a
field whose primitive element is _not_ a multiplicative generator, this will
throw a warning.

## Conversions
If you specify your own minimum polynomial, we make no assumptions about
conversions between fields. For example, when defining
```julia
const F = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚ÇÇ Œ≤^2 + Œ≤ + 1
const G = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚ÇÇ Œ≥^2 + Œ≥ + 1
```
an operation like
```julia
G(Œ≤)
```
will throw an error. The mathematical reason is that  the fields ``F`` and ``G``
are isomorphic, but there is two different isomorphisms. ("They are not _canonically_
isomorphic.") To choose an identification, you can use the `identify` function
(which is not exported by default, so we use its full path):
```julia
GaloisFields.identify(Œ≤ => Œ≥^2)
GaloisFields.identify(Œ≥ => Œ≤^2)
```
This allows for conversions such as
```julia
G(Œ≤)
convert(F, Œ≥ + 1)
```
The inner workings of this distinction are based on the symbol names. So
if you define ``F`` and ``G`` with the _same_ symbol and minimum polynomial:
```julia
const F = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚ÇÇ Œ≤^2 + Œ≤ + 1
const G = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚ÇÇ Œ≤^2 + Œ≤ + 1
```
then they are just considered equal and conversions work without extra work.

## Conversions for the default minimum polynomials
If you do not specify a minimum polynomial, for example by using
```julia
const F = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚Çà‚ÇÅ Œ≤
const G = @GaloisField! ùîΩ‚Çâ Œ≥
```
then we use [Conway polynomials][conway]. They have special compatibility
relations between them, allowing conversions:
```julia
Œ≤^10 == Œ≥
```
This works provided `F` and `G` have the same characteristic `p`. If the order
of either is a power of the other, we convert into the bigger field. If not, we
convert both into the field of order `p^N`, where `N` is the least common
multiple of the extension degrees of `F` and `G` over ‚Ñ§/p‚Ñ§.

## Constructing a tower of field extensions
In some applications of finite fields it is convenient to use extensions 
of already defined finite field, i. e. the extensions of the type
`G` of power `q^m` over `F` of power `q` where `q = p^n` for some integers `m, n`.
It is possible to construct an extension of already defined finite field:
```julia
# creating field with 29 elements
F = @GaloisField 29
# the polynomial x^2 - 2 is irreducible over F29
G = @GaloisField! F x^2 - 2
# the polynomial y^3 + 2y - 2 is irreducible over G
H = @GaloisField! G   y^3 + 2y - 2
# G is a subfield of H
# H has |G|^3 elements
```
